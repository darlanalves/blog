title: ESP8266 and I2C OLED displays
---

Finding software for Arduino nowadays is a breeze, which is great but also a hassle!

I just wanted to write a pixel into a small OLED display to test my [protocol](https://github.com/homebots/betty).
In order to get there, I'll have to read the entire library and figure out what it does. **_SIGH_**
